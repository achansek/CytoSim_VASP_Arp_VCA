# CytoSim_VASP_Arp_VCA
 
* This repository contains the following.
* The source code that was used to generate the results is also shared. VCA model required a minor code edit.
* The input files for Arp2/3 sweep Arp23_concsweep_steric
and Arp2/3, VCA sweep VCA_Arp23_concsweep_steric_kunbind_0.
* The analysis scripts are given in Analyze_data.ipynb to both analyze CytoSim trajectories and to plot necessary plots.
* These results are presented here. https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.06.23.546267
* The intermediate CSV files obtained from analyzing trjectories can be found in folder PLOTCSVFILES
